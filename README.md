# Disclaimer

I (TakumoZero) am not responsible for any damage that this tool might cause when not used properly

# How to use:

0. Install Python on your system if not already installed on the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Download the submission.py file and execute it

2. Check the labels you want to submit your song to

3. Fill out the Name Field and the Artist(s) field (separate with a "," if there are more than 1 Artist)

4. Type in the Message that will be sent in the Body part of the E-mail (dont forget to put a google drive / dropbox link of your song since there is no option to attach files {yet})

5. Type in your E-Mail address that is going to be used to send the submissions (only @gmail.com addresses will work)

6. Put in the Google App Password of the E-Mail you typed in
     - go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
     - give the Password a name and click "create"
     - write down the key you see in a blue box since you are not able to see it ever again
     - put this exact code into the Google App Code Box inside the tool

7. Press Submit and everything should work (if not, the error will be shown or available in the log.txt file in the same directory as the submission tool)
